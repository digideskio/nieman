2012","overview":"<p>In August 2005, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> acquired Android, a small startup company based in <a href=\"/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto\" title=\"Palo Alto, CA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palo Alto, CA</a>.  Android&#8217;s co-founders who went to work at Google included <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andy-rubin\" title=\"Andy Rubin\">Andy Rubin</a> (co-founder of <a href=\"/company/danger\" title=\"Danger\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danger</a>), <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/rich-miner\" title=\"Rich Miner\">Rich Miner</a> (co-founder of Wildfire), <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-sears\" title=\"Nick Sears\">Nick Sears</a> (once VP at <a href=\"/company/t-mobile\" title=\"T-Mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">T-Mobile</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-white\" title=\"Chris White\">Chris White</a> (one of the first engineers at <a href=\"/company/webtv\" title=\"WebTV\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebTV</a>). At the time, little was known about the functions of Android other than they made software for mobile phones. This began rumors that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market, although it was unclear at the time what function they might perform in that market.</p>\n\n<p>Android has a large community of developers writing applications (&#8220;apps&#8221;) that extend the functionality of the devices. There are currently over 200,000 apps available for Android. Android Market is the online app store run by Google, though apps can also be downloaded from third-party sites. Developers write primarily in the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java libraries.</p>\n\n<p>The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code under the Apache License, a free software and open source license.</p>\n\n<p>The Android open-source software stack consists of Java applications running on a Java-based, object-oriented application framework on top of Java core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework, SQLite relational database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating system, including the Linux kernel, consists of roughly 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of XML, 2.8 million lines of C, 2.1 million lines of Java, and 1.75 million lines of C++.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,138],"assets/images/resized/0004/1621/41621v6-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,230],"assets/images/resized/0004/1621/41621v6-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,415],"assets/images/resized/0004/1621/41621v6-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Nick","last_name":"Sears","permalink":"nick-sears","image":{"available_sizes":[[[83,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7693/17693v1-max-150x150.tiff"],[[111,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/7693/17693v1-max-250x250.tiff"],[[111,200],"assets/images/resized/0001/7693/17693v1-max-450x450.tiff"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Rubin","permalink":"andy-rubin","image":{"available_sizes":[[[138,150],"assets/images/resized/0001/7691/17691v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[230,250],"assets/images/resized/0001/7691/17691v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[300,326],"assets/images/resized/0001/7691/17691v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Rich","last_name":"Miner","permalink":"rich-miner","image":{"available_sizes":[[[121,121],"assets/images/resized/0001/7692/17692v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[121,121],"assets/images/resized/0001/7692/17692v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[121,121],"assets/images/resized/0001/7692/17692v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Chris","last_name":"White","permalink":"chris-white","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":50000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/08/googles-16-biggest-acquisitions-so-far-and-what-happened-to-them/","source_description":"Android

moment they&#8217;re ready to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Felix revolutionizes local advertising by offering the first Pay Per Action phone call product to local businesses. Instead of paying for clicks or phone calls, a business only pays for potential customers. The way Felix does this is deceptively simple and hides enormous complexity from the tens of thousands of local businesses. Felix utilizes over 200 different advertising relationships to place business clients in premiere spots whenever a consumer is looking for a local provider.  Felix also deeply inspects the value of each advertising buy it makes using its state of the art telephony analytics engine. Felix automatically transcribes and analyzes each phone call, then analyzes the call to ensure that it was really from a consumer interested in doing business with the client. </p>\n\n<p>The reporting mechanism for Felix provides a simple, intuitive breakdown of what&#8217;s going on with each call. This reporting allows clients to easily measure returns with the services, as well as providing valuable information to help business owners train and improve customer service with their staff.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,84],"assets/images/resized/0018/8219/188219v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,140],"assets/images/resized/0018/8219/188219v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,253],"assets/images/resized/0018/8219/188219v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Brent","last_name":"Metz","permalink":"brent-metz","image":{"available_sizes":[[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9416/59416v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9416/59416v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[125,125],"assets/images/resized/0005/9416/59416v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"General

Well, to be truthful, they were in the SaaS business before it was even called that. Remember hosting, ISPs, MSPs, ASPs and the like? But whatever the buzzword of the day is, LiveOffice was founded to help organizations, large and small, archive, discover and manage their most mission-critical applicationâ€”email.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, LiveOffice doesn&#8217;t sell you softwareâ€”they provide you with software PLUS service. Capital expenditures, storage, backups, networks, replication, disaster recovery, clustering, upgrades, maintenance, monitoring and management headaches are squarely in their court. Whatâ€™s in your court? Peace of mind, superior technology and reliable service. LiveOffice ensures you can rapidly deploy the system and have 99.99% uptime, so you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and always available.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing speaks louder for them than their 10-year track record of processing and protecting millions of messages a day and 99% client-retention rate. Every email they handle benefits from a tried-and-true email platform built on a multi-million dollar infrastructure. More than a decade of email experience has earned them a premier client roster, ranging from established Fortune 100 companies to fledgling organizations that are just opening their doors.</p>\n\n<p>In case you didnâ€™t know, they&#8217;re crazy about email. But LiveOffice is even more passionate about doing everything we can to meet customersâ€™, partnersâ€™ and employeesâ€™ needs. </p>\n\n<p>Backed by leading private-equity firm Summit Partners, LiveOffice has more than 100 employees with deep experience in managed messaging solutions, including executives and board members from Symantec, Microsoft, FrontBridge and Postini.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,39],"assets/images/resized/0004/0148/40148v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,66],"assets/images/resized/0004/0148/40148v2-max-250x250.png"],[[272,72],"assets/images/resized/0004/0148/40148v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder,

Watch\"","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":7,"stoned_day":8,"source_url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/20923/page8/","source_text":"NEW YORK (June 30, 2008) Peer39 today announced the launch of SemanticMatchâ„¢, the world's most advanced semantic advertising platform. Based on natural language processing and machine learning, Peer39's patented algorithms understand content meaning and sentiment, enabling precision targeting down to the page level so that display ads appear on pages most relevant to their message. SemanticMatchâ„¢ gives brands the necessary protection to target any page, including inside social media, and opens entire new targeting capabilities to online brand and performance advertisers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMatthew S. Goldstein, who has been Senior Vice President, Revenue Operations for TACODA since June 2006, has joined Peer39 as the company's Chief Operating Officer. He will report to Amiad Solomon, CEO, and be based in New York.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Matthew was an integral part of the success that TACODA enjoyed as it was purchased by AOL, and with MTV Networks' online operations,\" says Mr. Solomon. \"We are pleased to have someone with his depth of experience joining us in establishing Peer39 as the market leader in semantic advertising solutions.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"Semantic targeting is widely seen to be the next stage of advertising technology, beyond contextual or behavioral. What makes Peer39 different is that ads are targeted to the meaning of pages rather than to pre-selected keywords. The problem with keywords, as is well-known, is that they can be highly irrelevant to the actual page and conversation happening,\" says Mr. Solomon. \"We eliminate the errors that can plague keyword targeting and unlike other forms of online targeting, Peer39's SemanticMatchâ„¢ does not set cookies or track user behavior.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"When I studied the next generation of ad targeting technology, it was clear immediately that Peer39 has taken granular targeting to its deepest level by understanding page meaning and sentiment,\" says Mr. Goldstein.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor publishers, including portals, news sites, ad networks, social media, blogs, and forums, Peer39's technology effectively monetizes a wide range of online content and increases the value of content pages that grow revenue and ROI. Using SemanticMatchâ„¢, advertisers simply decide where they seek to reach users in the marketing sales funnel â€“ anywhere from awareness (\"autos\") to consideration (\"SUV\") to preference (\"hybrid\") to purchase and retention â€“ and the system automatically targets their ads to relevant pages, without the need for keyword targeting or setting cookies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, the company announced that it had closed $8 million in Series B financing with Canaan Partners as the lead investor and with participation from existing investors, Dawntreader Ventures and JP Morgan.  \"Advertisers and publishers continue to seek better, more effective ways to reach and market to consumers online,\" says Warren Lee, principal at Canaan Partners.  \"With past investments in innovative online advertising companies such as DoubleClick and Tremor Media, we here at Canaan are excited to be working with the Peer39 team to further develop its unique technologies and to scale its business.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally, Peer39 announced its advisory board consisting of Eytan Elbaz (co-founder of Applied Semantics, inventor of AdSense), Daniel Jaye (former President of TACODA), and Daniel T. Ciporin (former Chairman and CEO of Shopping.com-eBay).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPeer39 (www.peer39.com) is the global leader in semantic advertising solutions. Based on natural language processing and machine learning, Peer39's patented algorithms understand page meaning and sentiment, and deliver the most relevant and effective brand safe online advertising. Headquartered in New York City, Peer39 maintains a research and development center in Israel. Peer39 Labs conducts primary research in semantic web technologies resulting in a number of patents covering its technology and business practices.","source_description":"MIT's Technology Review: Ten Web Startups to Watch","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Peer39","permalink":"peer39"}},{"description":"Former 'WSJ' Publisher Joins Advisory Board of Peer39","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":2,"source_url":"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003958492","source_text":"","source_description":"Editor & Publisher","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Peer39","permalink":"peer39"}},{"description":"Newsweek.com chooses Peer39 for its semantic publisher  monetization solution","stoned_year":2009,"stoned_month":5,"stoned_day":6,"source_url":"http://www.foliomag.com/2009/newsweek-uses-semantics-boost-cpm","source_text":null,"source_description":"Newsweek Uses Semantics to Boost CPM","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Peer39","permalink":"peer39"}},{"description":"Replacing the reports that previously delivered data about content and advertising is a real (or near-real)-time dashboard.

designed for an Internet-savvy audience that seeks quality content about specific, narrow and in-depth topics, but quick production time that leverages lower costs.  With the proliferation of mobile video, iPods, Tivo and other Internet-connected set-top-boxes, Revision3 believes that tailored, on-demand video will continue to increase in importance versus traditional broadcast content developed for very broad audiences.  Revision3 video content focuses on technology, comedy, music, cooking, and other niche subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Revision3 attempts to be agnostic about how its content gets distributed. The company works with multiple distribution platforms, including iTunes, Odeo, Bittorrent, and Palm.  Revision3 also supports multiple video encoding formats, including flash, to help make content broadly accessible.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,40],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-150x150.png"],[[180,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-250x250.png"],[[180,49],"assets/images/resized/0000/0955/955v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Revision3","permalink":"revision3","image":null},{"name":"Best

The result is a small form factor server that uses one-quarter of the power and requires only one-sixth of the space used by traditional servers. SeaMicro servers are plug-and-play—they require no changes to software operating systems, applications, or management infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about SeaMicro, please contact us at info@seamicro.com </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,52],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-250x250.png"],[[306,64],"assets/images/resized/0007/8835/78835v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$35M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Draper via TC","raised_amount":15000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2009,"funded_month":7,"funded_day":24,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)","permalink":"draper-fisher-jurvetson","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-150x150.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-250x250.png"],[[222,157],"assets/images/resized/0001/0989/10989v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]},{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://gigaom.com/cleantech/seamicro-raises-20m-for-low-power-servers/","source_description":"SeaMicro raises $20M for low power servers","raised_amount":20000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":6,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":334000000,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"http://www.seamicro.com/node/242","source_description":"AMD Completes Acquisition of SeaMicro","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":3,"acquired_day":23,"acquiring_company":{"name":"AMD","permalink":"amd","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-250x250.png"],[[300,114],"assets/images/resized/0002/1627/21627v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sunnyvale","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,87],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,146],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,263],"assets/images/resized/0017/3361/173361v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"_id":"50c393ad2c25a04d7201379f"},{"name":"Seed Labs","permalink":"seed-labs","crunchbase_url":"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seed-labs","homepage_url":"http://www.seedlabs.com","blog_url":"","blog_feed_url":"","twitter_username":"","category_code":null,"number_of_employees":null,"founded_year":null,"founded_month":null,"founded_day":null,"deadpooled_year":null,"deadpooled_month":null,"deadpooled_day":null,"deadpooled_url":null,"tag_list":"","alias_list":"","email_address":"","phone_number":"866-276-9376","description":"","created_at":"Thu Jun 14 11:43:58 UTC 2012","updated_at":"Thu Jun 14 11:55:36 UTC 2012","overview":"<p>Seed Labs is the leading provider of mobile applications for consumer and social events, with a goal to translate the experience of your event into a mobile application.

communicate with any device on the grid. The company&#8217;s clean-tech innovations in the two-way delivery of real-time energy usage data over public wireless networks (AT&amp;T, Rogers, T-Mobile, etc.), in lieu of private network build-outs, have simplified SmartMeter deployments for over 100 major North American electric utilities.</p>\n\n<p>Smart Grid Infrastructure</p>\n\n<p>A smart grid infrastructure is the sum of services, devices and software necessary to add a layer of intelligence onto todayâ€™s 20th-century electricity grid such that every point on that grid can talk to every other point and decisions are made either by devices or human beings to fully optimize the process by which electricity is generated and delivered to customers.</p>\n\n<p>A smart grid infrastructure can spot and stop energy â€œleaks,â€ optimize efficiency through better power factors and provide feedback loops that provide the right price signals to normalize energy loads during peak use. According to the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in partnership with the Department of Energy, the total potential benefit of implementing smart grid technologies over the next 20 years is conservatively estimated to have a present value of $75 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Vision</p>\n\n<p>SmartSynch creates extraordinary value for our customers by providing innovative Smart Grid Infrastructure solutions that leverage public wireless networks.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,30],"assets/images/resized/0008/0414/80414v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,50],"assets/images/resized/0008/0414/80414v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[403,82],"assets/images/resized/0008/0414/80414v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$48.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"debt_round","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1486884/000114036110011812/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC D","raised_amount":11000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":15,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"c","source_url":"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Battelle+Ventures+Joins+$12-million+Series+C+Financing+of+SmartSynch,...-a0137640718","source_description":"Battelle Ventures Joins $12-million Series C Financing of SmartSynch, a Leader in Wireless Smart Metering Technology; Marks the Fund's Second Investment in the Energy Sector.
